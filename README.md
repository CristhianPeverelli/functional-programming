# F# dump
This repository contains F# files that I have written while learning and practicing the F# programming language. F# is a powerful functional programming language that offers concise and expressive syntax, strong typing, and excellent support for parallel and asynchronous programming. It is an open-source language that runs on the .NET platform and is known for its ability to combine the benefits of functional programming with the object-oriented programming paradigm.

## Why this rep
As a beginner to F#, I started this repository as a place to experiment with the language, explore its features and capabilities, and practice writing code in a functional programming paradigm. The code in this repository covers a variety of topics, ranging from basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts such as functions and modules, object-oriented programming, parallel and asynchronous programming, and more. Each file is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept or problem, making it easy to understand and learn from.

## What to expect
In this repository, you will find F# code snippets that demonstrate how to use different data structures and algorithms, such as lists, arrays, maps, sets, and sequences. You will also find examples of how to use F# to solve common programming problems, such as sorting and searching, string manipulation, and file I/O. One of the great things about F# is its ability to easily create parallel and asynchronous code, and this repository includes examples of how to use F# to write code that runs concurrently and asynchronously, such as using the async and Parallel modules to speed up computations.

## Conclusion
If you are interested in learning F# or are looking for a new language to add to your programming toolkit, I encourage you to explore the code in this repository and experiment with F# for yourself. F# has many benefits as a programming language, including its conciseness, expressiveness, and support for functional programming paradigms. By practicing with the code in this repository, you can become more comfortable with the language and develop your skills as a functional programmer.
